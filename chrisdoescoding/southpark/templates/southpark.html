        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            Back in 2014, Hulu became the exclusive online streaming
            service for all seasons and episodes of South Park.  Prior to
            that, all episodes were available for free on
            SouthParkStudios.com.
        </p>

            The killer feature back on SPS was the ability to click "Watch
            a Random Episode".  For certain fans like me, I've already
            watched every single episode at least once, and watching them
            in sequence doesn't really appeal to me anymore.
        </p>

            As of this writing, Hulu continues to not provide
            an episode randomizer feature.  This page provides a
            launching point to randomize an episode.  Each click of the
            "Go!" button or the button below will take you directly to
            Hulu.  You will still need access to a Hulu subscription
            to watch the episode.
